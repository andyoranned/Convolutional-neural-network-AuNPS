# Reuse
Please acknowledge your source if you choose to reuse this code. As so much of it was influenced by others, I don't feel that I have permission to say do as you please with it. 

Feel free to use this as a starting point of building your own dataset for personal projects. There's not as much information out there for beginners to build a custom dataset. Most everything available for n00bs has you importing the MNIST dataset, but that has major limitations. 

# This makes no sense... 
Feel free to send me a text on Line @gluay_gluay_ if you need any help understandind what's going on here. You can find the original Jupyter notebook, along with the datasets that I used on my Kaggle account under the same username as my GitHub, @andyoranned.
