Please acknowledge your source if you choose to reuse this code. As so much of it was influenced by others, I don't feel that I have permission to say do as you please with it. 

Feel free to use this as a starting point of building your own dataset. There's not as much information out there for beginners to build a custom dataset. Most everything has you importing MNIST dataset, but that has major limitations. Feel free to send me a text on Line if you need any help understandind what's going on here. You can find it, along with the datasets that I used on my Kaggle accound under the same username as my GitHub, @andyoranned.
